# Aviation Risk Analysis - README

![Aircraft Safety Overview](https://th.bing.com/th/id/R.85f03a53a593d4531a20299e94c989e1?rik=C1f65IBZPz5WUQ&pid=ImgRaw&r=0)

# Project Overview
This project analyzes aviation accident data to determine which aircraft present the lowest risk as part of a business initiative to enter the aviation industry. The analysis includes data cleaning, imputation, aggregation, and visualization to generate actionable insights for aviation investment decisions.

# Business Problem
As the company seeks to expand into aviation operations, it needs data-driven guidance on which aircraft to purchase for commercial and private use. By leveraging aviation accident records from 1962 to 2023, we can identify patterns and risk factors associated with different aircraft, flight purposes, and conditions.

# Dataset
The dataset comes from the National Transportation Safety Board and includes:
- Flight purpose and operation type
- Phase of flight (e.g., takeoff, landing)
- Weather conditions
- Aircraft make and model
- Injury data from aviation accidents

# Key Findings
### 1. **Risk by Flight Purpose**
- **Lowest risk:** Aerial Application, Banner Towing, Glider Towing
- **Highest risk:** Executive/Corporate and Skydiving flights

### 2. **Risk by Flight Phase**
- **Lowest injuries:** Maneuvering, Go-around, Landing
- **Highest injuries:** Taxiing, Standing, Climb/Descent
